notes: |
    - Avoid using bold and italics
    - Use 19px for body copy – 16px for smaller screens
    - Use smaller sizes only if there’s a user need (eg 16px, 14px, 12px)
    - Make sure lines of text don’t exceed 75 characters, as they become harder to read beyond that point

<p class="govuk-body">
  A 19px body copy paragraph. This includes even more text to give a good representation of a more average length paragraph. That way you can see more than one line wrapping.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body-s">
  A 16px supporting text paragraph.  This includes even more text to give a good representation of a more average length paragraph. That way you can see more than one line wrapping.
