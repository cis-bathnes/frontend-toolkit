notes: |
    - Don’t disable buttons, unless there’s a good reason to
    - If you have to disable buttons, make sure they look like you can’t click them (use 50% opacity)
    - Use the aria-disabled attribute for older screen readers
    - An example of a useful disabled option is a calendar with greyed out days where no bookings are available
    - Provide another way for the user to continue, add an error message or text to explain why the button is disabled
