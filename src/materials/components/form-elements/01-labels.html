notes: |
    - All form fields should be given labels
    - Donâ€™t hide labels, unless the surrounding context makes them unnecessary
    - Labels should be aligned above their fields
    - Label text should be short, direct and in sentence case
    - Avoid colons at the end of labels
    - Labels should be associated with form fields using the for attribute

    **Note:** When building out forms make sure each form field has it's own unique ID.
