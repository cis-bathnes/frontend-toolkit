  When to use this component
  - Use the panel component to display important information when a transaction has been  completed.
  
  - In most cases, the panel component is used on Confirmation pages, to tell the user they have successfully completed the transaction.
  
  When not to use this component
  - Donâ€™t use the panel component to highlight important information within body content.
  
  How it works
  - If you add extra content to the panel, to meet colour contrast ratio requirements use a font size of govuk-body-l for normal weight and govuk-body for bold.
