notes: |
    Use a free text box if you expect a broad range of address formats and you don’t need to use specific sub-parts of the address (for example, street or postcode).

    **Advantages of a free text box**

    A free text box:
    - can handle any possible address format
    - allows users to copy and paste addresses from their clipboard
    - means users don’t have to work out which part of the address goes in which field

    **Disadvantages of a free text box**

    A free text box:
    - makes it hard for you to separate an address into sub-parts, and impossible to do with 100% accuracy
    - might not be compatible with legacy backend systems that use multi-field addresses
    - can’t help users look up an address
