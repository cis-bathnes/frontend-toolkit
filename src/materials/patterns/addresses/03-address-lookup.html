notes: |
    An address lookup (sometimes called a ‘postcode lookup’) lets users specify a UK address by entering their postcode (and optionally their street name or number) and selecting their address from a list.

    **Advantages of address lookup**

    Using an address lookup means that:
    - people entering UK addresses don’t have to enter as much information manually
    - there’s less chance of mis-typed UK addresses

    **If you use an address lookup**

    When using an address lookup you should:
    - make it clear that the address lookup only works for UK addresses
    - provide a manual option for people with international addresses or addresses that are missing or badly formed in the Royal Mail database
