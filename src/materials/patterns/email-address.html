notes: |
    When asking users for their email address, you should:
    - make the field long enough
    - make it clear why you’re asking
    - help users to enter a valid email address

    You may also need to check that users have access to the email account they give you.

    **Make the field long enough**

    Make sure the field is long enough to accommodate at least 95% of your users’ email addresses.

    You can analyse your user data to establish what this is. A good rule of thumb is 30 characters.

    **Tell users why you want the email address**

    Make it clear what the email address will be used for so that:
    - users feel confident that you’re not going to abuse it
    - users with multiple email addresses can choose which one to give you

    **Help users to enter a valid email address**

    Help your users to enter a valid email address by:
    - checking that what they’ve entered is in the format of an email address allowing users to paste the email address
    - using the type=“email” attribute so that devices display the correct keyboard
    - play their address back to them so they can check and change it

    You can also check for common misspellings of popular email providers (for example ‘homtail.com’ instead of ‘hotmail.com’). Warn users if you detect one, but allow them to proceed in case it’s a genuine email address.

    Some services ask users to repeat their email address. This adds work for the user and should not be implemented unless your research has shown it to be effective.
