notes: |
    If you have to ask about gender, you should:
    - list the fields in alphabetical order: ‘Female’, ‘Male’, ‘Unspecified’
    - do research to test that this works for your users

    **Avoid using pronouns**

    You should address the user as ‘you’ where possible and avoid using gendered pronouns like ‘he’ and ‘she’.

    In some cases you may need to use pronouns, for example if your service allows people to jointly apply for something.

    **Don’t use titles to guess gender**

    You shouldn’t guess someone’s gender based on a title because:
    - some titles aren’t gendered (for example Dr, Rev, Major)
    - titles can be changed by deed poll to one that’s different from a person’s gender or sex
