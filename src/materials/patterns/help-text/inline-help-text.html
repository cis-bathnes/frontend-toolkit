notes: |
    Inline help text is short, clear text positioned immediately next to the part of the page it relates to.

    Use inline help text for help thatâ€™s relevant to the majority of users.

    You should place inline help for form fields between the label and the field so sighted users and screenreaders can read it before they get to the field itself.
