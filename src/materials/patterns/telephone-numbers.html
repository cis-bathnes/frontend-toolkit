notes: |
    First, test your service without any progress indicators. Many services are simple enough that users donâ€™t need them.

    Try improving the order, type or number of questions before adding a progress indicator.

    If people still have problems then try adding a simple step or question indicator.

    This approach is compact and usually enough to give people the confidence to continue.

    Only include the total number of questions if you can do so reliably. If the total number changes as the user continues through the service, make sure you update the indicator.
