	<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Sorry, this property is not entitled to any parking permits</h2>
	<p class="govuk-body">This property is <strong>not entitled to any parking permits or visitor permits</strong> because it was built or converted after 2006. Parking in Bath is hugely over-crowded and unfortunately we have had to stop permits being issued for new properties. Find out more about this in the <a href="">Transport and parking policy</a>.</p>

</div>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What are my options?</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>For short-term use you may want to look at <a href="">nearby car parks and on-street parking</a>. Residents <a href="https://secure.mipermit.com/bathnes/Register/ProductRegister.aspx?PermitType=RESSAVER">apply for a 10% discount</a> on car parking charges.</li>
<li>You might also want to consider joining a <a href="">city car sharing club</a></li>
<li>Bath also has extensive <a href="">public transport links</a></li>
<li>If you do not agree with this entitlement ruling you have the <a href="">right to appeal</a>.</li>
